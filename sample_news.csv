Dogecoin’s price is currently attempting to break out from ...,"Key Takeaways CleanCore Solutions announced plans for a Dogecoin treasury. Dogecoin (DOGE) trades below the $0.235 horizontal resistance. Dogecoin’s price is currently attempting to break out from a wedge. On Sept. 2, CleanCore Solutions announced a $175 million move to position itself as a Dogecoin (DOGE) treasury company. Treasury strategies have become a trend this year, with most firms focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) . CleanCore tried to take a different route with Dogecoin — but the market didn’t buy in. The company’s stock tumbled nearly 60% after the news, while Dogecoin’s price stayed largely unchanged. With that in mind, let’s break down DOGE’s price action and where it could be headed next. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin has been riding an ascending support trend line since October 2023, bouncing multiple times along the way — most recently in July 2025. That rebound sparked a sharp rally, breaking through a long-standing resistance line that had capped price action since the previous high.

DOGE slipped back under the key $0.235 horizontal level, which has flipped into resistance. Today, the token is trading close to where it stood before the move, raising questions about whether the breakout was a false start. Momentum signals remain indecisive. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is exactly 50, while the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is near neutral at 0. That leaves the outlook murky on the weekly chart. The likeliest scenario is consolidation, with Dogecoin chopping between its long-term support at $0.180 and resistance at $0.235 until a clear trend emerges. Can Dogecoin Break Out? The shorter-term six-hour chart shows that Dogecoin completed a five-wave upward movement (green) and possibly a W-X-Y corrective structure. The corrective structure could be different, since there is no ratio between waves W and Y. Currently, the Dogecoin price is breaking out from the descending wedge, which encompasses the final portion of the upward movement. Because of the breakout, the price of Dogecoin is likely to increase to at least the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement resistance level at $0.236, which also coincides with the long-term horizontal resistance. Like the weekly time frame, the RSI and MACD are neutral. The former is at 50, while the latter is still below 0. So, a short-term increase toward resistance is likely, but the future trend remains unclear until Dogecoin closes above $0.235. Final Thoughts In conclusion, Dogecoin’s price action remains indecisive despite the breakout attempt, with consolidation between $0.180 and $0.235 appearing most likely in the short term. While the short-term wedge breakout suggests a possible move back toward resistance, momentum indicators remain neutral and do not provide a strong directional signal. A clear bullish trend will only be confirmed if DOGE manages a decisive weekly close above the $0.235 level.

Will the SOMI price pump or dump after launch? Somnia (SOMI) has officially launched its long-awaited mainnet, marking a significant milestone after more than 18 months of development. The rollout was smooth overall, despite a few minor hiccups that briefly disrupted activity. With exchange listings already secured, let’s analyze the SOMI price movement to see where it will go next. Somnia Mainnet Launch After 18 months of development, Somnia went live on the mainnet on Sept. 2 and immediately gained support from several large centralized exchanges, including Binance and Bitget. The network claims to have a throughput of more than one million transactions per second and a finality of less than one second, combined with low fees.

Somnia aims to compete in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming sectors. Its native token, SOMI, has use cases in governance, transaction fees, and validator rewards. The launch went successfully, but there were some minor issues with it. The claims page broke under heavy traffic, which also caused the Quill allocation issue. The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) was targeted by a DDoS attack, which was fixed in 30 minutes. Quickswap hit a last-minute issue, but it has been fixed since. With that in mind, let’s analyze the SOMI price action to figure out what lies ahead. SOMI Price Analysis There is insufficient price action to make a SOMI prediction, so the analysis should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, since its launch, the SOMI price has traded inside an ascending parallel channel and is currently in the channel’s lower portion. Not only do these channels usually contain corrective movements, but the fact that SOMI trades in the lower portion makes a breakdown even more likely. If that happens, the SOMI price could fall to the $0.45 horizontal support area or possibly decline to a new all-time low. This has been the case with several new Binance listings , which pump briefly after their listing but decline massively afterward. Successful Mainnet Launch While Somnia’s mainnet debut was a success, its short-term price action remains uncertain, with early indicators pointing to potential downside risk. Binance listings have previously crashed shortly after launch, and the price action suggests the same could happen to SOMI.

2,How These 3 Privacy Protocols Are Becoming DeFi’s Next Infrastructure Layer,"The privacy conversation around decentralized finance has reached a cultural inflection point, as over 3,000 [...]","The privacy conversation around decentralized finance has reached a cultural inflection point, as over 3,000 daily conversations now flood crypto Twitter with founders , protocols , and influencers all converging on the same realization: privacy can no longer be marketed as a premium feature; it must become foundational infrastructure . Against this backdrop of collective awakening, privacy-first protocols are witnessing massive adoption as the market rushes to deliver the most elegant solutions for traders seeking to reclaim control over their on-chain activity. When Privacy Becomes a Default Expectation While the first wave of privacy protocols like Zcash and Monero attracted cypherpunks and libertarians, today’s “privacy summer” movement includes everyone from retail users to Wall Street institutions, signaling that privacy has shifted from fringe concern to mainstream necessity. The scale of this shift becomes clear in the numbers: $3.1 billion exploited from DeFi protocols in H1 2025 alone 510 million people worldwide now hold cryptocurrency as of 2025 DeFi market projected to hit $42.76 billion by 2025 , with 43.0% CAGR 14.2 million active DeFi wallets globally are processing $48 billion in weekly transaction volume 92% of Americans now worry about online privacy , with 76% demanding that companies do more Here are the privacy protocols building the infrastructure for DeFi’s anonymous future. PrivacyCash PrivacyCash represents a new generation of privacy-focused protocols, specifically designed for the Solana ecosystem. While still in development on devnet, PrivacyCash has processed over $1.1M in volume and aims to enable users to “Send SOL privately” with a focus on simplicity that could finally make privacy accessible to mainstream users. Key features: Low-Cost Privacy : Leveraging Solana’s fee structure to provide affordable privacy solutions Simplified User Experience : Making private transactions as intuitive as regular transfers for everyday users Native Solana Integration : Built specifically for Solana’s unique architecture, processing private transactions at network speeds Why it matters: By prioritising usability, PrivacyCash highlights how privacy can be normalised for mainstream users within fast-moving ecosystems like Solana. HoudiniSwap HoudiniSwap has emerged as one of the most comprehensive cross-chain privacy solutions in DeFi, processing over $1.6 billion in transaction volume while serving more than 150,000 customers who refuse to trade in the surveillance economy. Advanced capabilities: Dual-Exchange Tunneling : Exchange A handles initial funds and routes through randomized Layer 1 chains, while Exchange B completes the swap Cross-Chain Invisibility : Seamless privacy across 100+ blockchains and 4,000+ assets, making it impossible to trace fund movements Real-Time Extraction Protection : V4’s live “extraction comparison” feature shows users exactly how much they’d lose on competing platforms Why it matters: HoudiniSwap demonstrates that privacy and cross-chain liquidity can coexist at scale, enabling traders to move capital invisibly across the multichain economy. Aztec Network Aztec approaches privacy as a programmable primitive that can be embedded directly into application logic, having processed over 15,000 transactions with 20,000 full nodes running. The protocol gives developers control over what remains visible and what stays encrypted through its Noir programming language. Technical innovations: Dual-State Architecture : Supporting both public and private transactions within the same smart contract ecosystem zk-Rollup Foundation : Combining scalability improvements with privacy guarantees through encrypted batch processing Programmable Privacy : Developers implement sophisticated privacy models where specific data elements are selectively disclosed Why it matters: Aztec shifts the privacy conversation from transactional anonymity to composable application-level control, providing infrastructure for complex DeFi use cases The Next Phase of Privacy in DeFi Privacy in DeFi is no longer a niche concern but a fundamental requirement for mainstream adoption, as evidenced by the billions in volume flowing through protocols like PrivacyCash, HoudiniSwap, and Aztec, while regulatory clarity and institutional demand reshape the industry narrative. The infrastructure choices being made today will determine whether decentralised finance matures into a privacy-resilient alternative to global finance, or remains an experimental playground vulnerable to surveillance and exploitation. With institutional flows unlocking billions in capital and cultural momentum driving the narrative forward, the privacy revolution is only just beginning. The protocols laying the groundwork now are positioning themselves at the centre of DeFi’s next evolution.

3,Cronos (CRO) Sees 25% Drop From August High — September Rally Still Missing,"Despite CRO’s decline, a falling wedge and oversold MFI point to a bullish reversal. Active addresses have surged to the highest in three years, showing user engagement. ...","Key Takeaways Despite CRO’s decline, a falling wedge and oversold MFI point to a bullish reversal. Active addresses have surged to the highest in three years, showing user engagement. CRO could break $0.32, rally toward $0.39, and, in a strong bullish scenario, hit $0.58. After a strong run last month, Cronos (CRO) has lost momentum. The token has slipped from its August peak of $0.34 to $0.25, marking a 25% pullback. For many market watchers, August’s rally looked set to spill into September. But so far, that continuation hasn’t materialized. In this analysis, CCN reveals what’s keeping CRO stuck, and what could lie ahead for its price. Cronos Slips From August Highs Last week, CCN reported on the factors that fueled CRO’s breakout. But as of now, the trend has shifted, with the token dropping to $0.25. On the daily chart, the decline pushed the Cronos crypto into lower highs, while the Money Flow Index (MFI) slipped below 20.00 yesterday, signaling that the cryptocurrency had entered oversold territory.

The MFI has now broken out of that downtrend , hinting that buying momentum may return. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) adds weight to this outlook. On the chart, the AO is now flashing green histogram bars, a signal that momentum is shifting away from bearish control and tilting back toward the bulls. If this trend continues, it could further validate the falling wedge setup. In this case, CRO bulls may defend the support at $0.25, possibly retesting the overhead resistance at $0.31. On-Chain Activity Hits Multi-Year Highs From an on-chain perspective, Santiment data shows that Cronos’ active addresses have surged to 32,000 — its highest level since March 2022. A spike to multi-year highs suggests that engagement with the Cronos ecosystem is growing rapidly, indicating stronger demand for the native CRO coin. Therefore, this surge could be a tailwind for CRO’s price, especially if it coincides with technical signals hinting at a reversal from oversold conditions. In short, rising address activity gives the Cronos crypto a stronger fundamental base, potentially providing the fuel it needs to rebound from its recent dip. CRO Price at Crossroads Back on the technical side, the daily chart shows that CRO has formed a bullish pennant. This pattern signals the next leg higher after consolidation. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, adding strength to this outlook. This suggests that momentum is shifting back in favor of buyers. If this trend holds, CRO’s price could break above the $0.32 resistance. A successful breakout would likely lead to a climb toward $0.39. In a highly bullish scenario, with strong market conditions and rising demand, the Cronos crypto could extend its rally to $0.58. On the flip side, if demand weakens and buying momentum fades, this outlook may not materialize. In that case, CRO could retreat toward $0.20, testing lower support again.

Hyperliquid has captured nearly two-thirds of the DEX market share. Does the on-chain data ...,"Key Takeaways Arthus Hayes boldly predicted that Hyperliquid will surge 16x by 2028. Hyperliquid has captured nearly two-thirds of the DEX market share. Does the on-chain data back Arthur Hayes’ bullish Hyperliquid prediction? Arthur Hayes has never been shy about bold predictions, and his latest target is Hyperliquid, the decentralized exchange (DEX) that has created a monopoly in DEX perpetuals trading. In his view, Hyperliquid will grow 16x by 2028, potentially overtaking Binance as the largest cryptocurrency exchange. With nearly two-thirds of the DEX market already under its belt, Hyperliquid has quickly outperformed its competition. However, the question is whether the numbers support Hayes’ vision. A closer look at Hyperliquid’s growth, tokenomics, and on-chain data sheds light on that bullish thesis. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) explicitly built for perpetual futures trading. Unlike many other decentralized platforms, it offers the speed, efficiency, and advanced tools usually reserved for centralized exchanges (CEXes) Its trading interface is virtually identical to one from Binance, Bybit, Crypto.com, or any other CEX.

A scale order allows the user to place orders split between a range of your choosing, while a TWAP order does the same, though over a time range instead of a price range. The platform is built on its custom Layer-1 blockchain, utilizing a consensus mechanism called HyperBFT derived from the high-performance HotStuff protocol. This combination empowers Hyperliquid with sub-second transaction finality, enabling lightning-fast trades. At its core, Hyperliquid operates via a fully on‐chain order book, allowing users to place bids and asks in real time just like on a traditional centralized platform, even though everything is permissionless and recorded on-chain. Importantly, Hyperliquid is self‐funded, rejecting venture capital in favor of community alignment. It was founded by Jeff Yan and Iliensinc, former Harvard classmates, alongside a team with expertise from institutions like Caltech, MIT, and Citadel. The team aims to build a platform that evolves based on community feedback and needs, rather than external investor pressure. Hyperliquid Tokenomics The ecosystem’s native token is HYPE, which provides governance and staking purposes while offering fee incentives. So, users can stake the token for profit, hold it to pay lower fees, or even participate in governance by influencing future protocol upgrades, adding new trading pairs, or adjusting fees. HYPE debuted on Nov. 29 at $3.90, with a total airdrop value of $1.2 billion, one of the largest and most successful airdrops ever. A key aspect of the token’s design is its deflationary mechanism. Hyperliquid allocates a portion of its trading fees to automated buybacks and burns. As of the time of writing, nearly 385,000 tokens have been burned , amounting to 0.04% of the supply. Such a burn mechanism supports price stability and incentivizes long-term holders by reducing the supply over time. The token distribution includes allocations for the genesis airdrop, core contributors, community grants, and a foundation budget. No further tokens have entered circulation since its Token Generation Event (TGE) in November, which released 31% of the total supply. So, only 31% of the total supply is circulating, while the rest is locked. The circulating supply becomes even smaller when considering the amount of HYPE burned. This supply freeze will continue until November 29, 2025, when daily emissions of 216,580 tokens will begin and continue through November 2028. Overall, Hyperliquid proposes a compelling blend of features, speed, advanced tools, transparency, and community-centric governance, which have redefined decentralized perp trading. Arthur Hayes’ Prediction Arthur Hayes’ bullish thesis on Hyperliquid rests on two main forces: fiat debasement and market dominance. Hayes argues that governments’ relentless money printing has forced ordinary people to speculate to maintain their standard of living. With a growing number of people holding savings on-chain in stablecoins, crypto becomes the natural asset class for speculation. Hayes sees Hyperliquid as the primary beneficiary of this shift. The DEX already commands roughly two-thirds of its market share , growing fast enough to challenge centralized giants like Binance. By the end of the bullish cycle, Hayes believes that Hyperliquid will become even bigger than Binance while remaining fully decentralized. Hence, he uses the Binance perpetuals share relative to the stablecoin supply to predict the HYPE price at the end of 2028. By 2028, he projects the stablecoin supply to reach $10 trillion. Applying Binance’s peak share of 26.4% to that supply, Hayes estimates Hyperliquid’s Average Daily Volume (ADV) could reach $2.63 trillion, up from the current $11.9 billion . With trading fees of 0.03%, that ADV translates to $258 billion in annualized revenue. Using a conservative 5% discount rate, Hayes calculates Hyperliquid’s terminal value at $5.16 trillion. This is 126 times higher than its current fully diluted valuation, leading to his 16x price prediction for HYPE. While Hayes’ math is sound, he makes two main assumptions that could ruin it in the future. Firstly, the stablecoin market cap must expand more than 36 times from today’s $277 billion to $10 trillion by 2028. Secondly, Hyperliquid must capture and hold a dominance level that matches or exceeds Binance’s peak. Another minor assumption is that fee structures will remain intact, but regulatory changes, fee wars, or user pressure could force them lower, reducing revenue projections. Hyperliquid’s Market Share When Hyperliquid entered the scene, few expected it to dominate the decentralized exchange (DEX) market so quickly. At its launch in March 2020, DYDX dominated the DEX landscape, holding more than 50% of the total share ranked by volume. Shortly after its launch, Hyperliquid (teal) started eating into the DYDX (blue) dominance. Hyperliquid is a direct competitor to DYDX, since its rise was nearly proportional to the latter’s decline. By late 2024, the tables had turned. Hyperliquid not only matched DYDX’s market share decline almost one-for-one, but it also secured an overwhelming lead. The turning point came with the launch of the HYPE token in November 2024, which turbocharged adoption and cemented Hyperliquid’s place at the top. This is an example of a well-executed airdrop of a native token, whose benefits encourage users to move from their competitors to Hyperliquid. As of the time of writing, Hyperliquid has 75% of the DEX market share. This is even better illustrated when considering the volume of the top main perp protocols since the start of 2024. While Hyperliquid took the lead in September 2024, it wasn’t until November, when the HYPE token launched, that it completely exploded. Since then, it has made a new high monthly, the most recent in August 2025. Even more remarkable is that Hyperliquid’s growth isn’t merely the result of siphoning volume from other DEXes. Its August 2025 trading volume alone exceeded the combined monthly volume of all other DEXes at any point in 2024. This suggests it’s attracting entirely new participants to decentralized trading. Hyperliquid vs Binance Despite its dominance over other DEXes, Hyperliquid still faces a significant challenge compared to the centralized giant Binance. The perps and spot volumes are still minuscule compared to the CEX, though the perps volume has shown promising growth since January 2025. Nevertheless, Binance still holds a 90 to 10 lead in perps and a 93 to 7 in spot volume. Hence, the data support one of Arthur Hayes’ predictions: Hyperliquid will dwarf all the other DEXes combined. However, it also suggests it is still far from taking Binance’s market share. On-Chain Growth In August, Hyperliquid’s monthly revenue reached a new all-time high of $106 million, surpassing July’s previous record of $86.6 million. In fact, Hyperliquid’s revenue has been higher than Robinhood’s for the past three months. Hyperliquid has also reached new all-time highs in various metrics, such as TVL, DEX volume, and perp volume, which have all steadily risen since the beginning of the year. Most of the TVL comes from USDC bridged on Hyperliquid through Arbitrum. The increase in revenue is directly reflected in the HYPE price. When using a moving average, the Hyperliquid revenue and HYPE price graphs nearly mirror one another, confirming their close correlation. This alignment is logical since a share of the revenue is allocated to token buybacks. In turn, the buybacks drive the HYPE price upward. The total number of users has also increased drastically since November 2024, coinciding with the HYPE token release. At the time, Hyperliquid had roughly 250,000 users , while its parabolic increase has taken it to more than 600,000 in seven months. Thus, the on-chain data confirms that Hyperliquid keeps breaking records each month and ties its rapid increase to the release of the HYPE token. Hyperliquid Price The HYPE price shows bearish signs despite reaching a new all-time high of $51.12 in August. The first sign comes from the shooting star candlestick right after the high (red icon), illustrating that the bulls could not sustain the rally. Momentum indicators also provide some bearish signs, since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) have generated bearish divergences (orange). Finally, the HYPE price has created an ascending wedge, considered a bearish pattern, further supporting the possibility of a breakdown. Despite all these warning signs, the HYPE trend is still bullish. Since April, the price has created higher highs and higher lows, confirming that bulls still have the upper hand. Nevertheless, the signs of weakening momentum are worrying since they could soon catalyze a bearish trend reversal. If the HYPE price breaks down from its wedge, it could find support near $35. Alternatively, the wedge’s resistance at $52 will likely provide resistance in case of an upward movement. Community Sentiment Even though the HYPE price is at an all-time high, the community could not be more bullish. They believe that the token is still undervalued. Yesterday, GLC_Research posted a long thread comparing its cash generation to Robinhood and Coinbase. Even though Hyperliquid operates at a similar scale with an even more structurally profitable model, its valuation pales compared to the other two when looking at metrics such as EBITDA. GLC echoes Arthur Hayes’ view, suggesting that Hyperliquid is gradually taking the market share of other CEXes. We have long been accustomed to seeing Hyperliquid dominate the perp DEX market, but what stood out most in the first half of 2025 was its growth relative to centralized exchanges, which are currently losing ground. Hyperliquid holds a set of competitive advantages that make it the most compelling venue to trade. First, it is one of the cheapest places to trade both spot and perpetual futures. It also offers the deepest onchain liquidity, with order book depth on certain assets now rivaling that of leading CEXs. This is supported by its ability to become the first venue to consistently list new cryptocurrencies . GLC also notes the massive increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) and buybacks to confirm the interest in the DEX and its alignment for providing value to its token holders. While not an apples-to-apples comparison, others have noted its massive revenue-to-market-cap discrepancy relative to Ethereum and Solana to come to the same conclusion. Conclusion Regarding crypto predictions, Hayes’ forecast for Hyperliquid might sound extreme, but the fundamentals are hard to ignore. The platform has already pulled off one of the most successful token launches in recent memory, turbocharging user adoption and trading volumes. Its fully on-chain order book, fast execution, and advanced tools make it feel like a centralized exchange. At the same time, its community-first approach has resonated with traders, especially regarding the buybacks of its native token, HYPE, aligning its goals with those of long-term holders. On-chain metrics show climbing revenue, buybacks support price growth, and the user base has tripled since the end of 2024. Still, the prediction faces major hurdles. For Hayes’ 16x call to hold, stablecoin supply needs to balloon to $10 trillion, and Hyperliquid must sustain dominance levels rivaling Binance’s peak. Yet, if any DEX has a shot at closing the gap with centralized giants, Hyperliquid seems best positioned. Whether Hayes proves exactly right or not, Hyperliquid has already secured its place as one of the defining crypto stories of this cycle. Crypto Somnia (SOMI) Launches Mainnet — Key Details Inside Crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Unaffected Despite Treasury Launch Crypto BEAM Rockets 30% Before Returning to Earth — Sudden Volatility Rattles Traders Arthur Hayes’ 16x prediction for Hyperliquid by 2028 is based on two big assumptions: that stablecoin supply will grow to $10 trillion and that Hyperliquid will capture Binance-level dominance. While the math is sound, the outcome depends heavily on market growth and competition. Hyperliquid has already overtaken DYDX, commanding about 75% of the DEX perpetuals market share. However, compared to Binance, it’s still smaller. Binance leads by a wide margin in both spot and perp volumes. The HYPE token gains value from governance rights, staking rewards, and reduced trading fees. A key driver is its deflationary buyback-and-burn mechanism, where trading fees are used to repurchase tokens from the market. This direct link between platform revenue and token supply helps support long-term price growth.",https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/arthur-hayes-hyperliquid-growth/,https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/arthur-hayes-hyperliquid-spotlight-growth-1024x576.webp,,ccnnews,https://www.ccn.com,23371.0,Valdrin Tahiri,,english,general,positive,2025-09-03 08:22:15+00:00,False,,89251facb0df7209215c46b7c8c8c985,2025-09-09 09:45:43+00:00,UTC,Ccnnewscrypto,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/ccnnews.jpg,"{'negative': 0.03, 'neutral': 0.24, 'positive': 99.73}"

ONDO’s price has broken above a descending channel, with several ...","Key Takeaways Ondo introduces 100+ tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on Ethereum, fully backed by broker-dealer assets. ONDO’s price has broken above a descending channel, with several indicators confirming buyers’ control. If hype fades into a “sell-the-news” event, ONDO’s value risks retracing toward the $0.50 support. Over the past 24 hours, Ondo (ONDO) has surged nearly 10% as excitement builds ahead of today’s Global Markets debut. The launch will bring more than 100 tokenized stocks and ETFs to Ethereum. The last time ONDO’s price touched $1 was in early August. But with this new development set to expand Ondo’s reach, the token now looks poised to push well beyond that level. Ondo Climbs on Tokenized Stocks Launch ONDO’s price action is closely tied to the debut of “Global Markets,” its new platform enabling tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on Ethereum and beyond. Market excitement ahead of this major rollout has fueled the rally. This move may not surprise seasoned market watchers. Ondo has long positioned itself at the forefront of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization , laying the groundwork for today’s Global Markets debut. Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin Binance Coin Tether XRP Dogecoin TRON Shiba Inu The Sandbox USD Coin Toncoin Solana Bitcoin Ethereum Tether Binance Coin USD Coin XRP Cardano Solana Avalanche Polkadot Dogecoin Polygon Matic Litecoin OMG Network Shiba Inu AS Roma Fan Token Juventus Fan Token BitShares Verge Qtum DigiByte TrueUSD Basic Attention Token Toncoin Ethereum Classic Zcash Dash Binance USD Dai Cosmos NEM TRON Monero EOS Stellar Bitcoin Cash Chainlink Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token Bitcoin Ethereum Bitcoin Cash Tether XRP Litecoin Dogecoin USD Coin Cardano Solana Ondo’s tokenized stocks and ETFs come fully backed by U.S. assets. Each token is secured by the underlying stocks and ETFs held at one or more U.S.-registered broker-dealers, along with cash in transit. This structure gives Ondo’s products a layer of transparency and credibility, anchoring them directly to traditional financial markets while bringing their accessibility to Ethereum. From a technical perspective, ONDO’s price has broken out of a descending channel, signaling that the recent downtrend may be over. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover. In line with this, the shorter Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has crossed above the longer EMA, indicating buyers are regaining control. If sustained, ONDO’s price could break the resistance at $1.01 and rise past the upper-level resistance at $1.11. Won’t End at Ethereum, Project Says Beyond the charts, Ondo confirmed that platforms including Bitget, OKX, and 1inch support the Global Markets launch. The project also revealed plans to expand beyond Ethereum, bringing its tokenized products to other chains. “Ondo Global Markets is going multichain, soon expanding to Ondo Chain, BNB Chain, Solana, and more, to make U.S. markets even more accessible worldwide,” The Institutional-Grade Finance project stated . ONDO Price Prediction: $2 Soon On the daily chart, CCN observed that the Money Flow Index (MFI) has climbed above the signal line, reflecting stronger inflows. This shift in momentum comes as the token flirts with the resistance line. If ONDO’s price manages to close above this level, it could open the door to higher price targets. If momentum holds, ONDO could break the $1.13 resistance and climb toward $1.52. The token’s market value could push above $2 in a highly bullish scenario. On the other hand, if the launch hype fades into a “sell the news” event, ONDO’s price may not hold its gains and could sink to $0.50.

SWIFT’s trust and network effect remain unmatched, with over 11,000 ...","Key Takeaways Ripple brings speed and efficiency, settling cross-border payments in seconds compared to SWIFT’s days-long processes. SWIFT’s trust and network effect remain unmatched, with over 11,000 institutions globally relying on it. The future is likely hybrid; SWIFT integrating blockchain elements, and Ripple adapting to regulatory and banking norms. The rivalry fuels innovation, pushing both Ripple and SWIFT to modernize, with end users set to benefit from faster, cheaper, more transparent payments. For decades, cross-border payments have been dominated by SWIFT, a cooperative network of banks that acts as the backbone of international money transfers. Now, Ripple, a technology company closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency, is posing a challenge. The rivalry of “Ripple vs SWIFT” pits an established banking behemoth against cutting-edge blockchain in banking. Can a modern blockchain network truly outsmart a 50-year-old system trusted by 11,000 banks? This article compares their histories, technologies, and recent developments to evaluate if blockchain-based solutions like RippleNet and the XRP Ledger can transform cross-border payments or if SWIFT will adapt and remain on top. The Legacy of SWIFT: Foundation, Growth, and Criticism SWIFT (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) was established in 1973 in Brussels by 239 banks across 15 countries . It was created as an answer to the slow, error-prone Telex system, with a vision “to transform the way value travels across borders.” Try Our Recommended Crypto Exchanges Sponsored Disclosure We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you.

By the time SWIFT went live in 1977, its secure messaging network had doubled its membership to 518 institutions in 22 countries. Over the following decades, SWIFT became the backbone of international banking, setting common standards for financial messages and expanding worldwide. Today, it connects over 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. Despite common misconceptions, SWIFT doesn’t actually move money, it sends payment instructions between banks. Each bank in the SWIFT network has a unique code (BIC/SWIFT code). When you initiate an international wire transfer, SWIFT securely transmits a standardized message to route funds from your account to the recipient’s account via intermediary banks. The actual fund settlement is handled by those correspondent banks, but SWIFT’s messaging makes it secure and standardized. This reliability and standardization are why SWIFT remains dominant, it offered a much faster, more reliable alternative to Telex, and over time banks invested heavily in SWIFT-compatible infrastructure. 1980s: Expanded to central banks, added value-added services. 1990s: Hundreds of millions of daily messages, 99.98% uptime. 2000s: SWIFTNet, ISO standards (15022 → 20022). 2017: Global Payments Innovation (GPI) enabled tracking and faster settlement. 2020s: Migration to ISO 20022, aiming for richer data and global standardization. Despite its success, SWIFT faces criticisms in an era of instant information. Traditional SWIFT transfers can be slow, often 1-3 business days for funds to move through multiple correspondent banks. Each intermediary may charge fees, making SWIFT payments expensive for businesses and consumers. They have also been opaque, where senders sometimes didn’t know the exact status or fees until the payment completed (SWIFT GPI has improved this by providing end-to-end payment tracking, akin to tracking a parcel). The G20 group of nations has explicitly set targets to improve cross-border payment speed, cost and transparency by 2027, indicating the pressure on systems like SWIFT to modernize. Additionally, SWIFT’s central role means it has been used as a geopolitical tool – for example, certain countries’ banks have been cut off from SWIFT as sanctions, underscoring SWIFT’s centralized control by major economies. Security has also been a concern : while the SWIFT network itself is secure, high-profile bank hacks (like the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist) exploited weaknesses in banks’ interfaces to SWIFT, prompting SWIFT to bolster security requirements. Critics in the fintech and crypto space often call SWIFT outdated, citing its batch processing and limited operating hours (it doesn’t settle on weekends), contrasting it with 24/7 blockchain networks. SWIFT has acknowledged these challenges and, rather than standing still, it’s working on solutions, including exploring blockchain integrations, which will be discussed later in this article. If America cut South Africa off from SWIFT, it would hit everyone: •Banks can’t move money internationally. •Businesses can’t pay for imports or get export money. •People can’t send/receive money abroad or pay for global services. •Government struggles to settle debts and buy... pic.twitter.com/wCvoZj6tYW — Sir Cabonena Alfred (@Lebona_cabonena) August 28, 2025 The Rise of Ripple: Crypto’s Cross-Border Contender Ripple is a San Francisco-based fintech company (founded as OpenCoin in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb) that developed the XRP Ledger , a blockchain designed for fast, low-cost payments. Ripple’s mission has been to make international money transfers as quick and seamless as sending an email. In contrast to SWIFT’s messaging-only approach, Ripple offers an alternative where value itself can be moved across a distributed ledger in seconds. The company’s vision is often summarized as enabling the “Internet of Value” – money moving as freely as information. Ripple’s network for institutions, formerly called RippleNet, leverages blockchain to let banks and payment providers settle transactions instantly, with XRP (its native digital asset) acting as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized blockchain that launched in 2013. It uses a unique consensus algorithm (not proof-of-work like Bitcoin ) which allows it to settle transactions in 3-5 seconds with minimal fees (fractions of a penny). It can handle about 1,500 transactions per second at baseline , far above Bitcoin or Ethereum, and roughly on par with major card networks in throughput.. XRP , the digital currency, can be used as a bridge asset – for example, converting USD to XRP, instantly sending XRP across the globe on the ledger, and converting into, say, EUR or JPY at the destination. This avoids the need for multiple correspondent banks and pre-funded nostro/vostro accounts in various countries. Ripple’s pitch to banks and remittance companies was that using XRP and Ripple’s technology could dramatically cut the cost and time of cross-border transfers while providing end-to-end visibility. Ripple gained attention mid-2010s by signing up a roster of banks and payment providers to pilot its tech. Notably, more than 100 banks at one point joined Ripple’s network (including Santander, Standard Chartered, and SBI Holdings) to experiment with blockchain for cross-border payments, although many trials were limited in scope. Some institutions used Ripple’s enterprise software (xCurrent) for instant messaging and settlement (without XRP), while others piloted XRP for liquidity (xRapid). Ripple’s technology saw real-world use in remittances: for example, MoneyGram, a major remittance firm, partnered with Ripple in 2019 to use XRP for settling forex, reporting faster and cheaper transfers – though that deal was suspended after U.S. regulatory issues arose. In Asia, Ripple’s partner SBI in Japan has used Ripple’s tech for transfers, and Ripple and SBI even launched a joint venture for blockchain-based payments. Ripple also forged relationships with central banks for research on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) , and its network is part of various pilot programs in regions like the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. 🚨 OF COURSE ITS DOCUMENTED #RIPPLE HAS PARTNERSHIPS WORLD WIDE.

Ripple faulted for some direct sales to institutions . After the SEC dropped the full appeal , Ripple gained clarity. Concerns remain about centralization – Ripple Labs holds large XRP reserves . Despite these challenges, Ripple has pushed forward, even expanding its services. It introduced its own stablecoin ( Ripple USD, ticker RLUSD ) in 2024 and has been positioning itself not just as a payments company but a broader crypto infrastructure player. As you’ll see next, recent developments from both Ripple and SWIFT show the race is far from over. SWIFT vs. Ripple: Key Differences at a Glance To better understand the “Ripple vs SWIFT” debate, let’s compare them on core aspects: As the table shows, Ripple’s blockchain-based system clearly outpaces SWIFT in speed and nominal transaction cost. Its transparency and continuous availability are also strong points. !!️RIPPLE = POSITIONED TO OUTLAST SWIFT AND BITCOIN + XRP IS DESIGNED FOR THE NEXT 70,000 YEARS!!️ Read closely. “...Ripple could survive as it is a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin network, and it could be used by traditional financial organisations for advanced experience of... pic.twitter.com/F6WxBPtESQ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 29, 2025 SWIFT, however, has an entrenched network and the confidence of global banks, along with an established compliance regime. These differences set the stage for how each is innovating to either maintain or chip away at that incumbent advantage. Ripple vs. SWIFT: Can Stablecoins, Banking Ambitions, and Blockchain Rails Rewrite Global Payments? Both SWIFT and Ripple have been active recently, taking bold steps that underline their competitive and perhaps complementary directions. Ripple is expanding beyond XRP into stablecoins with a plan to acquire Rail for $200 million . Rail is a Toronto-based platform that uses dollar-pegged tokens to move money across borders faster and cheaper than traditional rails. Ripple says the deal creates an end-to-end stablecoin payments stack, adding virtual accounts, automated back-office workflows, and a ready base of enterprise users already sending stablecoin remittances. The move reinforces Ripple’s 2024 launch of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar stablecoin, and positions it against established issuers. Rail claims it processes a meaningful share of global stablecoin payment activity and can settle in hours rather than days with lower fees. With regulatory clarity improving in the U.S., Ripple is betting that regulated stablecoins will become mainstream plumbing for cross-border payments . Strategically, the acquisition helps Ripple serve institutions that want crypto-speed settlements without asset volatility, while complementing XRP’s role as a bridge asset. It’s a signal that Ripple aims to own both the crypto-native and fiat-linked legs of the value chain. Ripple has applied for a U.S. national bank charter , seeking to operate as a federally regulated trust bank. This charter doesn’t allow retail deposits or lending, but it does enable custody and specialized banking services under federal oversight. The strategic prize is a Federal Reserve master account , which could connect Ripple directly to Fed payment rails and allow it to hold reserves, potentially including backing for its RLUSD stablecoin, in central bank money. That combination could support true 24/7 settlement, reduce dependence on intermediaries, and address risk and compliance concerns for institutions. The bid also signals a cultural shift: crypto firms aren’t just challenging banks from outside; they’re stepping into regulated roles to meet large customers where they are. For Ripple, a charter could strengthen credibility with conservative financial institutions, simplify onboarding, and cut costs across certain flows. It’s a hedge, too—balancing blockchain speed with the governance, audits, and controls that major counterparties expect in high-stakes cross-border payments. Ripple’s Resilience Questioned: SWIFT Innovation Boss Sparks Clash With “Dead Chain Walking” Remark Despite experimentation, not everyone at SWIFT is convinced by Ripple’s approach. In September 2025, Tom Zschach, SWIFT’s Chief Innovation Officer, publicly critiqued Ripple and the notion that surviving a legal battle (like Ripple’s SEC fight) proves resilience. In a LinkedIn post that stirred debate, Zschach argued that “surviving lawsuits isn’t resilience. Neutral, shared governance is.” He contends that true robustness in global payments will come from systems governed by industry-wide consensus, not by any single company or its ability to weather court cases. This was seen as a direct swipe at Ripple, which often points to its regulatory battles as tests of its durability. Zschach’s point was that banks won’t fully trust a network that is controlled (or perceived to be controlled) by a private company, and that compliance can’t be about one company getting approval, it must be about broad standards that everyone follows. He went further to label Ripple’s network a “dead chain walking” in terms of future relevance, according to reports of his comments . The SWIFT executive emphasized that trust, legal enforceability, and shared governance have underpinned every major shift in finance, implying that blockchains must meet these criteria to gain institutional adoption. In his view, many crypto innovations (from early internet payment schemes to decentralized finance) have failed to gain mass adoption due to a lack of this trust and compliance framework. This critique highlights a core philosophical difference: Ripple promotes technology and speed, while SWIFT’s camp stresses governance and risk management. Zschach acknowledged that by 2025, public blockchains will be “too significant to ignore” and are proving useful in areas such as tokenized bonds and fast cross-border payments. But he maintained they are only part of the solution – the final piece is the legal and institutional frameworks around them. However, Ripple’s advocates point out that XRP Ledger has been “battle-hardened” by running for a decade and surviving intense scrutiny. 🧐🔥 Most Banks Are Running on 1970s and 1980s Technology—No Wonder SWIFT Hasn’t Been Replaced So why hasn’t Ripple been adopted yet? Why is SWIFT’s market share so protected? Behind polished banking apps, the global financial system runs on mainframes and COBOL code from the... — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 2, 2025 They cite Ripple’s partnerships and Ripple’s role in establishing legal precedents during the SEC case as evidence that it’s moving the whole industry toward acceptance. This back-and-forth between the SWIFT and Ripple camps underscores that while technology is key, perception among banks matters. SWIFT is leveraging that narrative, essentially saying: we have neutral governance and decades of trust, which no fintech upstart can claim yet. It’s a reminder that in the realm of global finance, technology alone doesn’t guarantee success; governance, regulations, and network effects are equally critical.

Ripple’s ledger is decentralized in operation, but the company’s influence raises questions for risk committees. Ripple’s agility allows faster product iteration; SWIFT’s consensus culture can slow change but anchors trust. Regulation & compliance: SWIFT’s ecosystem embeds KYC /AML and sanctions processes at participating banks. Ripple gained clarity from recent legal outcomes and is pursuing a bank charter, while stablecoin frameworks are emerging. Both face ongoing regulatory scrutiny; policy can open doors or set higher bars. Technology & integration: Banks have deep SWIFT integrations. Ripple must prove low-friction interoperability (hence ISO 20022 alignment) and meet reliability thresholds at scale. Network effects: SWIFT’s ubiquity is its moat. Ripple is targeting niches, such as remittances, specific corridors, and stablecoin use cases, to build volumes and credibility. Demand for faster, cheaper payments is real; whichever rail meets it with minimal operational disruption will gain momentum. Conclusion: Coexistence, Competition or Convergence? You might be wondering how this story will play out? Rather than a simplistic “blockchain will kill SWIFT” outcome, experts foresee a more nuanced future. It’s very possible SWIFT and Ripple will coexist in the global payments ecosystem, each serving different needs or even interlinking. SWIFT’s own actions suggest convergence: by testing blockchain networks and eyeing tokenized assets, SWIFT could incorporate aspects of Ripple’s innovation into its service. In such a scenario, banks might continue using the SWIFT network for its compliance and messaging, while actual settlement of funds happens on crypto networks behind the scenes, essentially a hybrid model. This would mirror how the internet’s arrival didn’t eliminate older telecom companies but forced them to modernize; similarly, SWIFT could evolve rather than be outsmarted entirely. On the other hand, competition remains. Ripple’s long-term vision does challenge SWIFT’s correspondent banking model. Ripple executives have ambitiously predicted capturing a significant share of SWIFT’s volume by 2030. If Ripple (or others in the crypto industry) succeed in meeting the high bar of trust and compliance, banks may gradually shift certain types of transactions, e.g. low-value remittances or inter-company transfers, to blockchain networks to save cost and time. Smaller financial institutions, fintechs, and remittance providers might adopt Ripple’s technology faster (since they have less legacy infrastructure), nibbling at SWIFT’s edges. In regions with less developed correspondent banking, leapfrogging to crypto-based rails could occur, giving Ripple a stronger foothold. Thus, a competitive dynamic could see Ripple and SWIFT each trying to expand their share of cross-border flows. A third outcome is convergence through partnerships. Could Ripple and SWIFT directly collaborate? It might sound far-fetched, but consider that both ultimately aim to serve banks and end-users with seamless global payments. If market demand forces the issue, one could envision SWIFT establishing standards for using digital assets (maybe even XRP or stablecoins) within its network. Ripple, by getting a banking license and joining traditional networks, is in a way moving closer to SWIFT’s turf from the opposite side. Their paths may meet in the middle. It’s conceivable that a future cross-border transaction might involve a SWIFT ISO 20022 message to carry compliance information and beneficiary details, while the actual value is transferred via a Ripple-issued stablecoin or XRP on a blockchain. In that future, users might not even know a blockchain is involved, they’ll simply see faster, cheaper transfers. Coexistence could gradually lead to convergence, as the lines blur between “traditional” and “crypto” finance.

Ripple, Exchanges and the Rich List Explained Blockchain From Lawsuits to the Top 25: How Ripple Quietly Became a $15B Private Powerhouse FAQs What is the main difference between Ripple and SWIFT? SWIFT is a messaging network that instructs banks on how to move funds, while Ripple uses blockchain to transfer value directly in seconds, often with lower costs and full transparency. Why is Ripple seen as a challenger to SWIFT? Ripple’s XRP Ledger enables instant, low-cost, 24/7 cross-border transfers, addressing SWIFT’s long-standing pain points of delays, high fees, and limited transparency. Could Ripple replace SWIFT completely? It’s unlikely in the short term. SWIFT has decades of trust and global bank integration. Ripple may capture niches like remittances or stablecoin corridors, but a hybrid model, where both systems coexist, is more probable. What does SWIFT think of Ripple? While SWIFT is experimenting with blockchains like XRP Ledger, some executives remain skeptical. They argue that governance, trust, and compliance matter as much as speed, and call Ripple’s model too centralized for full bank adoption.",https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/ripple-vs-swift-blockchain-banking-behemoth/,https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xrp-breakout-all-time-high-1536x864-1-1024x576.webp,,ccnnews,https://www.ccn.com,23371.0,Dr. Guneet Kaur,,english,technology,neutral,2025-09-03 16:19:28+00:00,False,['XRP'],9948c75247dacfbf3bfb546a60936163,2025-09-09 09:45:43+00:00,UTC,Ccnnewscrypto,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/ccnnews.jpg,"{'negative': 3.72, 'neutral': 89.13, 'positive': 7.15}"

Yellow Card provides crypto exchange services as well as stablecoin and payments infrastructure across the continent. Chipper Cash is a mobile payments platform offering free domestic and low-cost international transfers. It also allows users to pay bills, invest in stocks, and access other financial services. In the announcement, Chipper Cash co-founder and CEO Ham Serunjogi said: “RLUSD is uniquely positioned to drive institutional use of blockchain technology across Africa and broader global markets, including through cross-border payments.” Finally, VALR is a South African-based global crypto exchange that claims to be Africa’s largest. It offers payment and institutional crypto solutions. Interestingly, RLUSD has been rolled out to support an extreme weather relief pilot project in Kenya. So far, this has backed farmers with drought insurance. Interestingly, RLUSD tokens are uniquely released automatically via smart contracts when satellite data confirms a drought is likely. Another similar pilot project to support an insurance solution for parametric rainfall is also underway. Expansion and Growth At present, Ripple is aggressively expanding outward. In the past month or so, it announced plans to launch RLUSD in Japan, acquired a stablecoin payments platform called Rail, and received approval for use in Dubai . Now, global payments behemoth SWIFT is conducting live trials with XRP Ledger and Hedera Hashgraph to see how it performs with international payments. These are significant victories for the newly-launched stablecoin, which crossed a market cap of $700 million on Sept. 2, 2025.

ETFs tallied $301.32 million in daily total net inflows on Sept. 3. This brings the week’s total to $634.09 million, following Monday’s $332.76 million in net inflows. The heightened action comes as investors anticipate the Fed lowering borrowing costs later this month. They also hope for two rate cuts by the end of this year. The week prior, funds had garnered $440.71 million, but had lost $1.17 billion during the week ending Aug. 22. Overall, August was the third-worst-performing month for BTC ETFs, which shed $751.12 million in monthly net outflows. February remains the worst with $3.56 billion in monthly outflows, followed by March’s $767.91 million. August’s losses were a small loss for funds as they had raked in $18.82 billion between April and July 2025. This shift came as investors increasingly turned their attention to Ethereum ETFs , which, up until recently, were winning big. Ethereum ETFs According to SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs recorded $38.24 million in daily net outflows, bringing this week’s total to $173.61 million so far. It also marks a third consecutive day of outflows, which have now reached $338.25 million. Last week, Ethereum funds ended August with $1.08 billion in weekly total net inflows, bringing the month’s total to a sturdy $3.87 billion. It’s their second-best-performing month of the year following July’s $5.43 billion, and beats June’s $1.16 billion. A three-month multi-billion run was likely to run out of steam at some point, and following BTC’s massive correction below $110,000, attention is peeling away from ETH ETFs once again, though not as significantly as before.

11,Polygon Analysis: Scaling Ethereum with Multi-Chain Tech,"Polygon processes 4M daily transactions with $1.13B tokenized RWAs, 117M+ wallets, and 120+ CDK chains as Ethereum's leading Layer 2 solution.","Polygon is a Layer 2 blockchain platform that scales Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain before committing checkpoints to Ethereum's mainnet, enabling fast and low-cost transactions while maintaining security. The platform functions as a multi-chain ecosystem that addresses Ethereum's scalability limitations through various technical approaches, including sidechains , plasma chains , and zero-knowledge rollups . What started as Matic Network in 2017 has grown into a blockchain infrastructure giant. Today, Polygon processes 4 million daily transactions across 117+ million total unique wallets—more than most standalone blockchains achieve. The platform hosts $1.13 billion in tokenized real-world assets across 268+ issuances, while maintaining transaction costs averaging $0.01 and achieving a current measured throughput of 1,000 transactions per second. What Is Polygon and How Does It Scale Ethereum? Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that processes transactions off-chain before committing periodic checkpoints to Ethereum's mainnet using Merkle roots. This enables faster settlement while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees. Unlike Bitcoin's Lightning Network, which requires channels, or Optimism's optimistic rollups that assume validity, Polygon combines multiple scaling approaches within a unified framework. The technical foundation supports sidechains, plasma chains (initially proposed by Vitalik Buterin ), zero-knowledge rollups (like zkSync), and validium implementations (similar to StarkEx) simultaneously. This multi-pronged approach contrasts with single-solution competitors, such as Arbitrum's optimistic rollups or Base's OP Stack implementation. The platform functions as the "" Value Layer for the Internet "" - a multi-chain infrastructure comparable to how TCP/IP enables internet communication. Four primary components coordinate to deliver a comprehensive scaling infrastructure: Polygon PoS chain - EVM compatibility with fast transactions that mirror Ethereum's smart contract functionality zkEVM - Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced scalability, implementing SNARK technology for general computation Miden rollup - Privacy-preserving applications using STARK proofs Chain Development Kit (CDK) - Enables teams to build custom Layer 2 solutions for application-specific blockchains Recent upgrades through Polygon 2.0 have unified these previously separate protocols under a single architectural framework. The AggLayer v0.2 and Heimdall v2 implementations reduced transaction finality to 4-6 seconds while cutting block intervals to 2 seconds, positioning the network for its ambitious roadmap target of 100,000 transactions per second through the Gigagas initiative. How Did Polygon Evolve From Its Original Design? Polygon's transformation from a simple sidechain to a comprehensive multi-chain ecosystem represents one of blockchain's most successful pivots. The journey spans multiple phases, each marked by strategic decisions that shaped today's platform. Polygon's journey began in 2017 when Indian developers launched Matic Network in Mumbai as a Plasma-based sidechain. They were implementing the scaling framework proposed initially by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Lightning Network creator Joseph Poon. The project represented one of the first practical implementations of the Plasma whitepaper for Ethereum scaling. The initial mainnet launch in 2020 featured both Proof-of-Stake and Plasma chains designed to handle different transaction types. This approach was similar to Ethereum's planned sharding strategy before the network pivoted to rollup-centric scaling. The dual-chain approach provided flexibility but lacked the unified vision that characterizes modern Layer 2 networks. The pivotal transformation occurred in February 2021 with the strategic rebrand from Matic to Polygon. This change reflected an expansion of ambitions beyond simple sidechains to encompass multiple scaling solutions, including zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and inter-chain protocols. Strategic acquisitions accelerated technical capabilities throughout 2021 and 2022: Hermez Network acquisition - $250 million investment to strengthen zero-knowledge proof capabilities Major funding round - $450 million raised in 2022 to support ambitious development goals zkEVM testnet launch - Practical implementation of theoretical scaling solutions demonstrated The introduction of Polygon 2.0 in 2023 represented the most comprehensive architectural evolution since inception. This upgrade proposed a unified architecture with the new POL token replacing MATIC, along with governance reforms and technical standardization across all network components. Implementation accelerated through 2024-2025 with key milestones: POL migration launch - September 4, 2024, achieving 99.18% completion by August 2025 Ecosystem expansion - Growth from 3,000 decentralized applications in 2021 to 120+ CDK-built chains by 2025 Performance improvements - Enhanced transaction speeds and reduced costs Who Founded Polygon and What Drives Its Leadership? The success of any blockchain project ultimately depends on the people behind it. Polygon's founding team brought together diverse expertise that proved essential for navigating the complex challenges of building scalable blockchain infrastructure. Four co-founders established Polygon, bringing complementary expertise in blockchain engineering, entrepreneurship, and product development. Sandeep Nailwal is the current CEO of Polygon Labs. He contributes blockchain programming expertise alongside entrepreneurship experience from founding health technology startups. His business development skills proved crucial in securing major corporate partnerships, which demonstrate institutional confidence in the platform. Jaynti Kanani served as the original CEO, bringing deep blockchain engineering experience, with a particular expertise in Ethereum protocol development and Web3 infrastructure. Anurag Arjun focused on product management as former Chief Product Officer, ensuring technical capabilities translated into developer-friendly tools and user experiences. Mihailo Bjelic contributed expertise in information systems engineering, essential for scalable infrastructure design, particularly in addressing multi-chain coordination challenges. The founding team's composition includes three Indian-origin founders and one Serbian founder, reflecting a global perspective from inception. This international approach proved advantageous for building relationships across different regulatory environments and market conditions. The current organizational structure divides responsibilities across three specialized entities: Polygon Labs - Development and technical advancement Polygon Foundation - Research, education, and governance initiatives Polygon Ecosystem - Grants and community development with 1 billion POL tokens allocated for community grants in 2025 Technical leadership includes notable blockchain developers like Daniel Lubarov, Antoni Martin, Jordi Baylina, Bobbin Threadbare, and Brendan Farmer. This expanded team brings specialized expertise in zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic security, and scalable blockchain architecture. What Technology Makes Polygon Different From Competitors? Polygon's technical architecture sets it apart from other Layer 2 solutions through several key innovations that address fundamental blockchain limitations. Rather than focusing on a single scaling approach, the platform combines multiple technologies to create a comprehensive infrastructure solution. Polygon's technical differentiation centers on zero-knowledge proofs and multi-chain validation capabilities that distinguish it from single-purpose scaling solutions like Optimism or Arbitrum . The platform's ZK-based solutions enable significantly higher throughput while pessimistic proofs provide additional security layers for complex cross-chain operations. Zero-knowledge proof implementation extends beyond simple transaction verification to enable complex privacy-preserving applications. The system supports confidential transactions while maintaining network auditability, addressing regulatory requirements that affect privacy-focused alternatives like Monero or Zcash. The multi-role validator system represents fundamental innovation in blockchain staking economics. Validators can stake across different chains within the ecosystem simultaneously, maximizing capital efficiency compared to traditional single-chain models. The POL token serves as a ""hyperproductive token,"" fulfilling multiple simultaneous purposes across the ecosystem. Token holders use POL for gas payments, participate in staking rewards across multiple chains, and engage in governance decisions. The AggLayer represents Polygon's most significant innovation for addressing blockchain interoperability challenges. This system functions as a liquidity aggregation protocol that connects multiple chains without requiring trust assumptions between validators. This approach differs from traditional bridge protocols that require separate validator sets, instead creating unified liquidity pools accessible across connected networks. Privacy and security enhancements include local execution capabilities in Miden for applications requiring enhanced confidentiality. The implementation of EIP-1559 fee market improvements provides more predictable transaction costs compared to the simple auction-based systems used by earlier blockchain networks. Advanced cryptographic techniques enable applications that require both transparency and selective privacy, addressing the fundamental blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization through mathematical proofs rather than relying solely on economic incentives. How Large Has Polygon's Ecosystem Grown? The true measure of any blockchain platform lies not in its technical specifications but in real-world adoption. Polygon's ecosystem demonstrates substantial growth across multiple application categories, with particular strength in areas requiring high transaction throughput and low costs. The platform currently hosts over 120 chains built using the Chain Development Kit. This represents significant adoption of its infrastructure-as-a-service approach. Decentralized finance applications lead adoption metrics, with established platforms maintaining significant value locked in smart contracts. Quickswap, the largest decentralized exchange on Polygon, holds a total value locked of $398 million (Sept. 2025) while processing thousands of daily transactions at significantly lower costs compared to Uniswap on the Ethereum mainnet. Gaming applications leverage Polygon's cost advantages for in-game transactions, NFT minting, and complex smart contract interactions that would be prohibitively expensive on Ethereum. Projects like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Aavegotchi demonstrate practical blockchain gaming applications requiring frequent micro-transactions with blockchain ownership guarantees. NFT platforms benefit from cost-effective minting and trading capabilities supporting both individual creators and large-scale commercial operations. The Instagram integration resulted in 2.5 million wallet creations, demonstrating mainstream accessibility for users without prior cryptocurrency experience. Real-world asset tokenization represents the fastest-growing application category with $1.13 billion in assets tokenized across 268+ distinct issuances. These applications span multiple asset classes: Government securities and municipal bonds Real estate investment vehicles and REITs Commodity-backed tokens including gold and agricultural products Corporate debt instruments and trade finance Infrastructure project financing and green bonds Enterprise partnerships demonstrate institutional confidence spanning multiple industries. Meta integrated Polygon for Instagram NFT functionality, enabling millions of users to interact with blockchain technology through familiar social media interfaces. Starbucks implemented loyalty programs using blockchain technology, while Reddit deployed community tokens for subreddit governance. JPMorgan built trading applications leveraging Polygon's infrastructure, and Fox Network uses it for content distribution. Flipkart's integrated e-commerce solutions demonstrate practical adoption by traditional businesses. Government adoption showcases public sector confidence with the Philippines' budget tokenization project representing the largest government blockchain implementation to date. The Department of Budget and Management launched this fully operational system in July 2025, using Polygon to notarize and publicly track key budget documents including Special Allotment Release Orders and Notices of Cash Allocation. This application demonstrates practical use cases for public finance management, transparency, and audit capabilities that traditional systems cannot provide. What Are POL Tokenomics and How Do They Work? Polygon's economic model underwent a fundamental transformation with the introduction of POL tokens. This shift represented more than a simple rebrand—it established the foundation for multi-chain operations and sustainable ecosystem growth. The $POL token replaced MATIC in 2024 as the cornerstone of Polygon 2.0's unified tokenomics model. This design supports multi-chain validation and ecosystem expansion. Unlike MATIC's fixed 10 billion token supply, POL features an infinite supply mechanism. This enables sustainable long-term network growth without artificial scarcity constraints. However, network fees partially burn POL tokens under specific conditions, creating deflationary pressure that helps balance the infinite supply mechanism during periods of high activity. Current circulation: 10.49 billion POL tokens as of September 2025 Original MATIC distribution structure: Ecosystem development initiatives: 23.33% Foundation operations: 21.86% IEO investors: 19% Team members: 16% Staking rewards: 12% Advisors: 4% Private investors: 3.8% This represents a more balanced distribution than many projects where teams and early investors hold majority stakes. The migration process from MATIC to POL achieved 99.18% completion by August 2025 through a straightforward smart contract swap mechanism, preserving all holder balances and staking positions. This technical achievement demonstrates the network's ability to execute complex protocol upgrades without disrupting user experience or security. Staking mechanisms enable POL holders to secure multiple networks simultaneously rather than limiting participation to single-chain validation. This implements concepts similar to shared security models. The multi-role validation system creates opportunities for higher yields and improved capital efficiency. Currently, 2.55 billion tokens are locked in staking. The governance framework evolved from centralized decision-making to community-driven proposals through Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs). Token holders participate in protocol decisions, resource allocation, and technical upgrade approvals through transparent voting mechanisms. Community treasury management demonstrates practical governance with the allocation of 1 billion POL tokens for grants in 2025, supporting: Developer incentives and recruitment Ecosystem growth initiatives Research projects and innovation Public goods development Providing a sustainable funding model for long-term ecosystem development. Protocol emissions offer sustainable incentives for network security through validator rewards, supplemented by additional revenue streams from connected chains that process stablecoin transactions. Network fees partially burn POL tokens under specific conditions, creating deflationary pressure that balances the infinite supply mechanism during periods of high activity. How Does Polygon's Governance System Function? Effective governance represents one of blockchain's greatest challenges. Polygon strives to strike a balance between community participation and the technical expertise necessary for making complex infrastructure decisions. Polygon utilizes a decentralized governance model, striking a balance between community participation and the technical expertise necessary for complex blockchain infrastructure decisions. The system recognizes that blockchain networks require both democratic input and specialized knowledge for optimal operation. The Polygon Improvement Proposal system enables any community member to suggest protocol changes, ecosystem improvements, or resource allocation modifications. Proposals progress through structured review stages, including technical evaluation, community discussion, and formal voting processes. The three-pillar governance structure under Polygon 2.0 encompasses: Protocol development - Technical upgrades and infrastructure improvements Tokenomics - POL supply, distribution, and utility decisions Community oversight - Resource allocation and ecosystem direction POL holders participate in staking decisions and voting processes, while technical decisions require additional input from qualified developers and researchers with relevant expertise. This creates checks and balances between different stakeholder groups. The Ecosystem Council serves as a specialized technical body responsible for smart contract upgrades and protocol security decisions. This structure strikes a balance between broad community input and the concentrated technical expertise required for complex modifications that could impact network security or functionality. Implementation of governance decisions follows established timelines and procedures designed to prevent hasty changes that could compromise network stability: Extended discussion periods for major protocol upgrades Technical audits before implementation Staged deployment processes enabling thorough testing Following the best practices established by critical infrastructure projects. Community treasury management is the most visible aspect of governance in practice, demonstrating the system's ability to make significant financial decisions through collaborative processes that incorporate diverse stakeholder perspectives. This creates accountability mechanisms for resource allocation decisions. Validator governance addresses network security and operational concerns through mechanisms enabling validator input on technical parameters. These decisions affect block production, transaction processing, and network upgrade coordination, requiring specialized operational knowledge. Transparency mechanisms ensure governance decisions and their implementation remain visible to all stakeholders. Regular reports, public discussions, and open development processes enable community oversight of both technical development and resource allocation decisions. What Recent Developments Are Shaping Polygon's Direction? Polygon's development pace accelerated significantly from 2024 to 2025, marked by major technical milestones and expanding real-world adoption. These recent developments provide insight into the platform's strategic direction and execution capabilities. Recent protocol upgrades demonstrate Polygon's ability to execute complex technical transitions while maintaining operational continuity. The transition of the original PoS chain to zkEVM validium architecture enhances security properties while maintaining backward compatibility with existing applications. Architecture Transitions: PoS to zkEVM validium - Enhanced security properties while maintaining backward compatibility AggLayer v0.2 deployment - Reduced transaction finality to 4-6 seconds Heimdall v2 implementation - Cut block intervals to 2 seconds for improved user experience AggLayer adoption accelerated significantly with 120+ chains connecting to the aggregated liquidity system throughout 2025. This growth demonstrates market demand for interoperable blockchain infrastructure and validates Polygon's strategic focus on multi-chain coordination rather than single-chain optimization. Real-world asset tokenization growth exceeded expectations with $1.13 billion in assets tokenized across 268+ issuances by September 2025. This adoption demonstrates institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance applications. Asset Tokenization Milestones: $1.13 billion in assets tokenized across 268+ issuances by September 2025 Government securities, real estate, commodities, and corporate debt instruments Institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance applications Government blockchain adoption shows accelerating momentum, particularly in budget management and public finance applications. The Philippines project serves as a successful model for other jurisdictions considering blockchain implementation for enhanced transparency and operational efficiency. Strategic partnerships continue to expand with enterprise clients implementing blockchain solutions tailored to specific business requirements. These relationships provide sustainable revenue streams while demonstrating practical blockchain applications that extend beyond speculative trading or simple token transfers. The Gigagas roadmap progress toward 100,000 transactions per second continues through systematic technical optimizations and architectural improvements. These developments aim to achieve performance levels comparable to those of traditional payment processors. Key development areas include: zkEVM mainnet deployment - Enhanced zero-knowledge proof capabilities Miden rollout expansion - Privacy-preserving applications for specialized use cases Performance targets - Aiming for throughput levels comparable to traditional payment processors What Challenges Does Polygon Face in Today's Market? Despite its technical achievements and growing adoption, Polygon faces a reality check in 2025. The Layer 2 landscape has become fiercely competitive, and the numbers tell a story that Polygon's leadership can't ignore. Base has emerged as the elephant in the room. Coinbase's Layer 2 solution leads with 21.7 million monthly active addresses versus Polygon's 5.96 million—a gap that's only widening thanks to Coinbase's massive user base and marketing muscle. While Polygon boasts 117+ million total unique wallets, the reality is that only a fraction remain actively used, a common pattern across blockchain networks that reveals the difference between hype and sustained engagement. The total value locked also shows some critical observations. Arbitrum maintains $3.22 billion compared to Polygon's $1.2 billion as of September 2025. These aren't just numbers—they represent real developer and user preferences voting with their wallets. The competitive pressure shows up in Polygon's own metrics, and the trends aren't encouraging. Active addresses dropped 12% in Q1 2025, while fee revenue plummeted 38% to just $835,000. Weekly decentralized exchange volume fell 20% to $1.2 billion, suggesting users are migrating to alternatives that offer better liquidity or user experience. These declines matter because they create a negative feedback loop. Lower activity means less fee revenue, which impacts the platform's ability to fund development and compete with well-funded rivals. Centralization concerns persist despite ongoing decentralization efforts: Top 10 token holders control approximately 88% of the supply (though most are smart contracts and exchange wallet addresses) Top 5 validators control 47% of staked POL Validator set remains capped at just 100 participants This creates more centralization than competitors like Ethereum's proof-of-stake system. Technical debt from rapid expansion creates its own problems. The platform must support legacy infrastructure while implementing next-generation solutions, forcing difficult tradeoffs between backward compatibility and innovation. Resource allocation becomes a zero-sum game when you're trying to maintain old systems while building new ones. Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. As governments worldwide develop blockchain policies, compliance requirements vary dramatically across jurisdictions. For a global platform serving diverse markets, this creates operational headaches that smaller, more focused competitors can avoid. How Is Polygon Addressing These Competitive Pressures? Rather than simply acknowledging challenges, Polygon has implemented specific strategies to maintain and expand its market position. The approach focuses on technical differentiation and sustainable competitive advantages that competitors cannot easily replicate. Polygon's response to competitive challenges focuses on technical differentiation through advanced zero-knowledge proof implementation and unique aggregated liquidity solutions that competitors cannot easily replicate. The AggLayer specifically addresses fragmentation concerns by enabling seamless cross-chain liquidity sharing without requiring manual asset bridging. This creates technical advantages through proprietary infrastructure and ecosystem integration. Core Competitive Advantages: AggLayer implementation - Seamless cross-chain liquidity sharing without manual asset bridging Multi-chain validation - Network effects that strengthen as more chains connect to the ecosystem Zero-knowledge proofs - Advanced cryptographic solutions for scalability and privacy The multi-chain validation model creates sustainable competitive advantages through network effects that strengthen as more chains connect to the ecosystem. Each additional chain increases the value proposition for validators and users while creating higher barriers to exit compared to single-chain alternatives. Protocol efficiency improvements through systematic upgrades demonstrate commitment to technical advancement despite market pressures. These provide measurable performance improvements while reducing operational costs for users and developers. Recent technical achievements include: zkEVM validium transition - Enhanced security with maintained compatibility Heimdall v2 implementation - Faster transaction processing and reduced costs AggLayer optimization - Improved cross-chain liquidity aggregation Strategic positioning in real-world asset tokenization and government applications creates defensible market niches that require regulatory compliance and technical reliability. These use cases favor established platforms with proven track records over newer alternatives that lack operational history and established regulatory relationships. This creates switching costs for enterprise clients through compliance certifications and integration complexity. Defensible Market Niches: Real-world asset tokenization - Regulatory compliance and technical reliability requirements Government applications - Proven track record and institutional relationships Enterprise partnerships - Sustainable revenue through actual utility rather than speculation The community treasury's allocation of 1 billion POL tokens for grants and ecosystem development creates powerful incentives for developer retention and attracting new projects. The funding enables competitive compensation for top developers while supporting innovative projects that might not receive traditional venture capital funding. The approach implements strategies used by major technology companies to maintain ecosystem leadership. Community Investment Strategy: 1 billion POL grant allocation - Competitive compensation for top developers Ecosystem development - Support for innovative projects lacking traditional VC funding Developer tools - Enhanced infrastructure and documentation Technical innovation continues through research and development investments in next-generation scaling solutions. The Gigagas roadmap and advanced cryptographic implementations position Polygon for future market cycles while addressing current performance limitations. Evolution of governance toward genuine decentralization addresses concerns about centralization through a systematic redistribution of power and influence. Community treasury control and validator diversification initiatives work to reduce concentration risks over time. Conclusion Polygon has grown from an experimental Ethereum sidechain into a multi-chain platform that actually works. The numbers speak for themselves: 4 million daily transactions across 117+ million wallets, with fees averaging just one cent. The platform maintains $1.2 billion in total value locked across DeFi protocols and $1.13 billion in tokenized real-world assets. The platform's true strength lies in its practical applications rather than its promises. Companies like Meta and Starbucks utilize it for real-world products, governments like the Philippines run budget systems on it, and $1.13 billion in traditional assets now reside on Polygon chains. The successful MATIC to POL token migration, reaching 99.18% completion, demonstrated that the team can execute complex technical upgrades without compromising stability—no small feat in blockchain.

The intent-based system abstracts blockchain complexity, making TRON’s DeFi ecosystem accessible to non-technical users, particularly for stablecoin transactions. Supports AI-driven transactions and agent-driven finance, aligning with the $36B AI token market and enhancing TRON’s high-throughput (2,000 TPS) capabilities. The beta launch in September 2024, combined with TRON’s stablecoin dominance and NEAR’s chain abstraction, positions this integration as a trending development with a potential for widespread adoption. Using NEAR Intents on TRON makes cross-chain swaps simple. Instead of juggling multiple wallets or using risky bridges , you can swap assets like USDT on TRON to tokens on NEAR or Ethereum in just one step. This works through an intent-based transaction system. Instead of telling the blockchain how to do something (e.g., which bridge or exchange to use), you simply state your intent , like “swap 100 USDT for ETH at the best rate.” A network of solvers then competes to find the best way to make it happen, and the transaction is settled securely. The result: faster, safer, and easier cross-chain interactions without needing to understand the technical details. This guide provides a step-by-step explanation of how to use NEAR Intents on TRON, tailored for both beginners and developers. What Are NEAR Intents and Why Use Them on TRON? NEAR Intents is a multichain transaction protocol that allows users to specify desired outcomes (e.g., “swap Token A for Token B”) and lets third-party solvers compete to provide the best execution path across blockchains .

without needing to understand blockchain mechanics, set up wallets on each chain, or bridge assets manually. This is particularly useful for TRON, which hosts a significant portion of USDT stablecoin transactions and has over 329 million user accounts and $28 billion in total value locked (TVL) as of September 2025. The integration, announced on September 4, 2025, simplifies DeFi and AI-driven interactions by abstracting blockchain complexity, making TRON more accessible for users and developers. How NEAR Intents Works NEAR Intents is a simple way to do things like swap tokens across different blockchains (like TRON to Ethereum ) without dealing with complicated steps. It’s like telling a smart assistant what you want, and it finds the best way to make it happen. Here’s how it works in three easy steps : You decide what you want to do, like “swap 100 USDT on TRON for another token.” You enter this goal (called an intent) into a supported app or wallet, like one on SwapKit.dev. Your request is sent to a group of helpers called Solvers. Solvers are like smart shoppers who search across blockchains and markets to find the cheapest and fastest way to complete your swap. They work off-chain (not directly on the blockchain) to find the best deal and send you a quote to approve. If you like the quote, you approve it. A special program called a Verifier on the NEAR blockchain checks everything to make sure it’s safe and correct. Then, your swap happens automatically, and you get your tokens—no extra steps needed! Users : Crypto enthusiasts, especially those using TRON for USDT transactions, benefit from simpler cross-chain interactions. Developers : Those building dApps on TRON or NEAR can leverage Intents for innovative cross-chain solutions. Investors : The rise of AI-driven DeFi and cross-chain protocols makes this a space to watch for investment opportunities. Before using NEAR Intents on TRON, ensure you have the following: TRON-compatible wallet : A wallet like TronLink (browser extension or mobile app) to manage TRX and TRC-20 tokens (e.g., USDT). TRX for fees : TRON transactions require bandwidth and energy, which can be covered by holding TRX (most transactions are low-cost or free within daily bandwidth limits). Access to supported platforms : Use wallets or dApps that support NEAR Intents integration with TRON, such as those listed on SwapKit.dev. TRON addresses (Base58, start with T) and TIP-191 signing (e.g., TronLink) are listed as supported. Basic understanding of Intents : Familiarity with intent-based systems helps, but NEAR Intents abstracts most complexities. Internet connection : For interacting with blockchain explorers (e.g., TronScan) or APIs. 🚨 @trondao x NEAR Intents is LIVE $USDT swaps from $TRON to $NEAR ; no wallet setup, no bridges, no chain switching. 🔁 Powered by @SwapKitDev 💻 Live on THORSwap, Trust Wallet & more 🌐 Native $TRX ↔ $USDT with $NEAR , $BTC , $ETH , $SOL , $XRP , $DOGE The future is seamless. pic.twitter.com/TBKZWJXZXx — NEAR Protocol (@NEARProtocol) September 4, 2025 Step-by-Step Guide to Using NEAR Intents on TRON Open the official demo: Go to the NEAR Intents demo site and choose a cross-chain token swap. Connect TronLink when selecting TRON: When the demo needs your TRON account, TronLink will automatically inject TronWeb and prompt you to connect (and later to sign). Approvals appear in a wallet popup. Submit your intent and review the quote: State the outcome you want (for example, “swap 100 USDT on TRON for ETH”). Off-chain solvers will compete to find the best path, and the app will display a quote. Approve and execute: I f you’re satisfied with the quote, approve it . The transaction is then executed through the NEAR Verifier smart contract. You’ll confirm where required with TronLink for the TRON side. Verify on TRONSCAN (optional): After execution, check TRONSCAN (the official TRON explorer) to view your transaction details. You can search by your wallet address or transaction ID, and optionally sign in with TronLink for convenience. Check balance s (optional): Use your TronLink wallet or TronScan to confirm the updated balance of USDT or other tokens post-swap. For example, to check a USDT balance, interact with the TRC-20 contract using TronWeb or TronScan’s smart contract interface. Explore further use cases (optional): NEAR Intents supports advanced use cases like trading NFTs, lending accounts, or even AI-driven transactions (e.g., agent-driven finance). Explore these on near.org/intents or SwapKit.dev. Confirm TRON support: TRON addresses (starting with “T”) and TIP-191 signatures are supported via wallets like TronLink. Pick an integration method: 1Click API: Use REST endpoints for quotes, deposits, and status checks. SDK (early stage): Embed ready-made components in your dApp. Request and deposit Call the /quote endpoint with swap details. Send assets to the unique deposit address provided. Optionally, submit the deposit transaction hash for faster processing. Track status: Use the /status endpoint to confirm when the transaction has executed Handle signatures: For deeper integrations , use TIP-191 signing with TronLink to approve payloads, then pass them to the NEAR Verifier contract for settlement. Manage TRON resources: Ensure the wallet has enough TRX to cover Bandwidth and Energy costs. Show transaction details: Display transaction hashes or IDs so users can confirm execution on TRONSCAN.

AI and DeFi integration : Supports AI-driven transactions and agent-driven finance, opening new use cases. Troubleshooting and Tips Transaction fails : Ensure your wallet has enough TRX for bandwidth/energy. Check TronScan for transaction status. Slow execution : Network congestion may delay intent resolution. Use platforms with optimized solvers like those on SwapKit.dev. Stay updated : Monitor near.org/intents or SwapKit.dev for updates on NEAR Intents’ features, solver network improvements, or new integrations. Since the protocol is live on TRON, check TRON’s official channels (e.g., TRON DAO on X, Telegram, or Medium) for ecosystem-specific announcements. Limitations and Considerations Protocol maturation : As of September 2025, NEAR Intents is actively integrated with TRON, enabling cross-chain swaps without bridging. While core functionality is live, some advanced features (e.g., complex AI-driven intents or broader chain support) may still be under development or optimization, as is typical for newly launched protocols. Expect iterative improvements through Q1 2026 as the solver network scales. No testnet deployment: According to the official NEAR Intents documentation , there is currently no testnet deployment — everything runs on mainnet only. That means you can’t try Intents on TRON’s Shasta testnet (or NEAR testnet) for now. The docs specifically state “no testnet deployment. Regulations: If regulators tighten rules around stablecoin transfers or cross-border swaps, platforms using Intents could face stricter compliance requirements (e.g., KYC /AML checks). This may affect liquidity, accessibility, and the speed of adoption in certain regions. Solver dependency: The efficiency of NEAR Intents relies on the solver network’s ability to find optimal cross-chain execution paths. Performance may vary based on liquidity, solver participation, or market conditions. For example, low liquidity for certain token pairs (e.g., TRX to obscure tokens) could result in suboptimal swap rates. Platforms like SwapKit.dev are working to expand solver networks to improve reliability. Market and competition risks : TRON faces competition from other layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot, which could impact its DeFi dominance. NEAR Intents competes with cross-chain solutions like Chainlink CCIP and LayerZero. While TRON’s low fees and 2,000 TPS throughput give it an edge, market volatility or regulatory changes could affect adoption.

Unlike traditional bridges, which require manual asset transfers and wallet setups across chains, NEAR Intents uses an intent-based protocol where users specify outcomes (e.g., “swap USDT for ETH”). Off-chain solvers find the best execution path, and a Verifier contract on NEAR ensures secure settlement, making it faster and more user-friendly. Can I use NEAR Intents on TRON without holding NEAR tokens? Yes, you don’t need NEAR tokens to use NEAR Intents on TRON. You only need TRX for TRON’s transaction fees (bandwidth/energy) and access to a compatible platform like SwapKit.dev. The intent system handles cross-chain interactions without requiring native tokens from other chains. What happens if a solver gives me a bad swap rate for my USDT on TRON? Solvers in NEAR Intents compete to find the best path for your cross-chain swap (e.g., USDT on TRON to ETH). If liquidity is low or solvers are limited, you might get a poor rate. To avoid this, use trusted platforms like SwapKit.dev, check quotes before approving, and ensure multiple solvers are active for better competition. Do I need wallets on multiple blockchains to use NEAR Intents with TRON? No. One of the main benefits of NEAR Intents is that it removes the need for multiple wallet setups. You can use a single TRON wallet (like TronLink) to initiate your swap, and the solver network handles the cross-chain execution behind the scenes.",https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/bridge-hacks-cost-billions-heres-how-to-safely-swap-usdt-on-tron-using-near-intents/,https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tron-didnt-replace-ethereum-1024x576.webp,,ccnnews,https://www.ccn.com,23371.0,CCN Editorial,,english,security & privacy,positive,2025-09-05 02:42:05+00:00,False,"['USDT', 'TRX', 'NEAR']",3ca868571d54fb78d8d088499604c764,2025-09-09 09:01:13+00:00,UTC,Ccnnewscrypto,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/ccnnews.jpg,"{'negative': 10.55, 'neutral': 2.14, 'positive': 87.31}"

Crypto-friendly Paetongtarn Shinawatra was removed over ethical violations. Despite leadership changes, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira remains in office. Thailand’s volatile political landscape shifted again this week as business magnate Anutin Charnvirakul was voted in as the country’s new prime minister, replacing crypto-friendly Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The shake-up has cast potential doubt on whether Thailand will maintain its momentum in digital assets, a policy area championed by Shinawatra and her predecessors. 0x Protocol 1inch Network Aave

OPES Finance Tribe Anutin Charnvirakul Appointed On Friday, September 5, Thailand’s parliament chose business tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul to become the 32nd Prime Minister of Thailand, marking the third leadership change in two years. The move came after Shinawatra was removed from office last week due to ethical violations over the handling of a border dispute with Cambodia, according to the BBC. Anutin’s rise marks a blow to the long-dominant Shinawatra family, which has been at the forefront of Thai politics since Paetongtarn’s father became Prime Minister in 2001. The new appointment has raised questions in the crypto community about the country’s future in digital assets. Unlike his predecessors, Anutin has little track record in the digital asset space. Crypto-Friendly Predecessors In August 2024, CCN covered the crypto-friendly stance of Thailand’s 30th Prime Minister, Srettha Thavisin, a former real estate tycoon with a strong history of backing blockchain projects. His flagship policy, the 10,000-baht digital wallet scheme, served both as a poverty alleviation program and an experiment in mass adoption of digital payments. That legacy was briefly continued by Shinawatra, who reassured voters that the government would press ahead with the policy, albeit with modifications to ensure financial sustainability. In January, Shinawatra also announced that the government would allow the use of payment products and services through digital assets in storage areas in Phuket. Hope for Thailand Crypto While the removal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra has created uncertainty, Thailand’s digital finance initiatives may not be derailed entirely. This is largely due to Pichai Chunhavajira remaining as deputy prime minister and finance minister, where he has overseen several digital asset experiments for the country. In August, Pichai spearheaded the launch of TouristDigiPay, a flagship initiative allowing foreign visitors to convert cryptocurrencies into Thai baht for use with participating merchants. Designed as an 18-month regulatory sandbox, the program was introduced as a bid to boost tourism revenue.

In brief Wall Street will advance privacy on Ethereum, according to Danny Ryan. Etherealize is building infrastructure for trading and settling tokenized equities. The company plans on leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Privacy advocates should be cheering on Wall Street’s adoption of cryptocurrencies, according to Etherealize co-founder and President Danny Ryan. As markets move on-chain, financial institutions are expressing a need for infrastructure that echoes elements of traditional markets, and privacy is “table stakes,” he told Decrypt . “The market does not, and cannot, function fully in the clear,” he said. “If we’re going to onboard the world to blockchains, ‘everyone sees everything all the time’ is just not going to work.” On Wednesday, Etherealize unveiled the closing of a $40 million funding round. The startup said it will promote Ethereum ’s use by developing infrastructure for the trading and settling tokenized assets that’s based around zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, among other tools. When transacting on a public blockchain, users leave a trail of evidence for anyone to analyze, and elite entities may cringe at the thought of treasury operations and trading strategies taking place in the open—even if blockchains prove more efficient than legacy systems. With the U.S. government’s prosecution of developers behind coin-mixing services like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet , it may feel like privacy may have become secondary, but Ryan described Wall Street’s needs as a potential Trojan horse, when it comes to sharing data on-chain. The benefits and normalization, he argued, should trickle down to average users. “As we begin to upgrade these markets, institutions will demand privacy, and we'll move the needle forward in terms of practical, applied and compliant privacy,” he said. A ZK proof is a method used in cryptography to prove that something is known without revealing the known information directly. The concept powers privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash , and historically, it’s been viewed as a way to help scale Ethereum. Ethereum’s ecosystem has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ZK-powered networks. Although Ryan thinks that gives its developers an advantage, some companies are taking a distinct approach to privacy in creating their own blockchains. Tempo, a blockchain incubated by payments giant Stripe and investment firm Paradigm, is set to feature built-in privacy measures. Arc, another layer-1 network that’s being developed by stablecoin issuer Circle, is expected to have “selectively shielded balances and transactions.” That suggests widespread privacy in crypto may not be contingent on Wall Street’s participation. But in the coming years, Ryan said privacy on Ethereum will likely become more commonplace, through “bespoke applications that handle privacy in a more granular way.” Daily Debrief Newsletter",https://decrypt.co/338324/wall-streets-needs-advance-ethereum-privacy-etherealize,https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fill:1024:512:1:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ethereum-decrypt-style-04-gID_7.jpg@png,,decrypt,https://decrypt.co,13386.0,André Beganski,business,english,"security & privacy,technology",positive,2025-09-06 14:01:03+00:00,False,,3adc5928e656809821aedc8bc213afe1,2025-09-06 19:15:22+00:00,UTC,Decrypt,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/decrypt.png,"{'negative': 0.14, 'neutral': 0.43, 'positive': 99.43}"

Institutional demand makes privacy a requirement for mainstream on-chain markets. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) enable verifiable transactions without revealing sensitive details. Etherealize closed a $40 million funding round to build ZK-powered trading and settlement infrastructure. Wall Street crypto privacy gains momentum as Etherealize builds ZK-based infrastructure — read how institutions will drive compliant on-chain privacy. Learn more from COINOTAG. What is Wall Street’s role in advancing crypto privacy? Wall Street crypto privacy is accelerating because institutions demand privacy-preserving infrastructure to trade and settle tokenized assets on public blockchains. Institutional requirements for confidentiality and auditability push developers to adopt tools like zero-knowledge proofs that hide sensitive details while preserving verification. How will Etherealize’s ZK infrastructure change institutional trading? Etherealize, led by co-founder and President Danny Ryan, closed a $40 million funding round to build trading and settlement layers that use zero-knowledge proofs . The approach enables institutions to prove compliance and correctness without exposing order books, treasury details, or strategy to public scrutiny. Ryan told COINOTAG that “the market does not, and cannot, function fully in the clear.” He argues institutional adoption will normalize practical privacy tools for broader users. This development aims to balance operational secrecy with on-chain efficiency and regulatory auditability. Why do institutions need privacy on public blockchains? Institutions handle sensitive treasury operations, counterparty agreements, and trading strategies that, if public, could harm competitive positions. On public blockchains, transaction transparency creates traceable evidence of activity. Privacy tools let firms transact on-chain while preserving commercially sensitive information. What are zero-knowledge proofs and why do they matter? A ZK proof is a cryptographic method to verify a statement without revealing the underlying data. Projects like Zcash historically used ZK techniques for privacy. In Ethereum’s ecosystem, ZK proofs also help scale and enable selectively private applications for institutional workflows. Frequently Asked Questions Will institutional privacy undermine regulatory oversight? Not necessarily. The models Etherealize and others propose aim for compliant privacy : verifiable proofs that satisfy audits and regulators without exposing merchant-sensitive data. The goal is selective disclosure for oversight, not blanket secrecy. How does recent enforcement affect privacy development? U.S. government actions against developers associated with coin-mixing services such as Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet have heightened scrutiny. That enforcement underscores the need for privacy solutions that incorporate compliance and accountability features. Key Takeaways Institutional demand is pivotal : Wall Street’s need for confidentiality will accelerate practical privacy tooling. ZK proofs are central : Zero-knowledge proofs enable verifiable privacy for trading and settlement. Compliant design matters : Privacy solutions must balance operational secrecy with auditability to satisfy regulators. How to implement institutional-friendly privacy on-chain (HowTo) Define compliance requirements: map reporting and audit needs. Choose privacy primitives: evaluate ZK proofs and selective shielding approaches. Design access controls: enable selective disclosure for auditors and counterparties. Test and audit: run third-party security and compliance reviews. Conclusion Institutional adoption is likely to make Wall Street crypto privacy a practical reality on Ethereum and beyond. Etherealize’s $40 million-backed push toward ZK-enabled trading and settlement exemplifies how firms can achieve privacy that is auditable and compliant. Expect institutional demands to accelerate tools that benefit both large firms and everyday users seeking better on-chain privacy.

Investors cautious amid ETF withdrawals and market uncertainties.Continue Reading:Crypto Prices Stall as Market Awaits Fed’s Next MoveThe post Crypto Prices Stall as Market Awaits Fed’s Next Move appeared first on COINTURK NEWS.","Bitcoin $ 110,608 ‘s price stalls at $110,500, and volatility has significantly decreased. Altcoins are also trading sideways, indicative of a broader market stagnancy. As discussions on the Federal Reserve’s independence increasingly reach courtrooms, global markets face pressure in the medium term. Consequently, cryptocurrencies have struggled to recover throughout September. Bitcoin (BTC) As ETF inflows turn negative again, investor risk appetite waned on Thursday and Friday. Investors concluded the week with net withdrawals from ETFs, opting for a cautious wait-and-see approach. It is not surprising to see investors pull back during such risky periods. Liquidations have decreased by 58% in the past 24 hours, and overall trading volume has declined similarly. BTC has failed to make higher peaks for an extended period, exhibiting subpar performance for around 24 days. While maintaining support at $108,000 for now, recent tests at the end of August and early September have weakened this support. Despite anticipated movements later in the day, daily trends are expected to remain sideways. Volumes are weak, investor sentiment is cautious, and BTC may see accelerated sell-offs if it closes below $110,000 without reclaiming support at $112,500. Cryptocurrencies As movements in BTC are unexpected, a significant volatility environment is also improbable for altcoins . Until the Fed meeting, it remains challenging to be optimistic about altcoins, making it crucial for John Cook’s situation to be clarified soon. Over the past year, crypto markets have constantly experienced declines due to external influences and pressures. Even with significant developments in crypto, the combination of tariffs, the Fed’s independence, wars, and sanctions equate to many similar experiences investors have become immune to. In the past 24 hours, WLFI has seen a surprising surge, moving considerably away from its pre-sale price. A gain of over 20% was unexpected. We had previously warned that those seeking easy short-sell opportunities might fall into such traps. OKB and ZEC are among other altcoins achieving double-digit gains today. The situation for altcoins is not particularly bright, especially for Ether, which is crucial. Friday’s $446 million outflow was unprecedented for a long time. This suggests a potential move below $4,000. Another concerning development is the loss of the 0.039 level in the ETHBTC pair, indicating a potential downturn to levels unseen in the past 17 days.",https://en.coin-turk.com/crypto-prices-stall-as-market-awaits-feds-next-move/,https://en.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cryptocurrency-news-1025.jpg,,cointurk,https://coin-turk.com,6230568.0,Ömer Ergin,cryptocurrency news,english,"economy,technical analysis",neutral,2025-09-07 02:25:38+00:00,False,,e636864cb44d70dcd90cadec9880d11b,2025-09-07 07:32:26+00:00,UTC,Cointurk,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/cointurk.jpg,"{'negative': 21.68, 'neutral': 77.44, 'positive': 0.88}"
